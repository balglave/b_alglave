### Spatial and spatio-temporal statistics for ecology

This is a short introduction of spatio-temporal modeling. It starts with basic concepts related to hierarchical modeling in a spatio-temporal context before moving to specific notions regarding the specification of the spatial and spatio-temporal variance-covariance function. Some inference methods are also described (kriging, maximum likelihood method and Bayesian inference with a focus on INLA). Some codes are presented to take in hand `R-INLA`, a R package to infer spatial and spatio-temporal models through Bayesian inference. Here are the <a href=ressource/pdf/cours_td_stats_st_2022.pdf>slides</a> and the related <a href=https://github.com/balglave/workshop/tree/main/cours_td_stats_st_2022/>codes</a>.

### Workshop on R-INLA

This is a short introduction to the `R-INLA` tool, a R package to infer spatial and spatio-temporal models through Bayesian inference. It first describes the global structure of the models implemented in `R-INLA`. Second, it introduces the SPDE approach and the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation two methods implemented in `R-INLA` to ease the computation burden related to spatial and spatio-temporal model inference. Here are the <a href=ressource/pdf/td_halieut_inla_2022.pdf>slides</a> and the related <a href=https://github.com/balglave/workshop/tree/main/td_halieut_inla/>codes</a>.
