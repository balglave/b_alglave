    "text": "I currently give the following courses at University Bretagne Sud and Institut Agro (Rennes). The teaching material should be online soon.\n\nDescriptive statistics (Bachelor)\nMaximum likelihood estimation (Bachelor)\nIntroduction to spatial and spatio-temporal statistics (Bachelor and Master)\nBayesian linear model (Master)\n\n\nIn addition, here are two workshops that I frequently give to ecologists and/or statisticians as an introduction to spatio-temporal modeling for ecology.\n\nSpatial and spatio-temporal statistics applied to ecology and environment\nThis is a short introduction to statistical spatio-temporal modeling. It starts with basic concepts related to hierarchical modeling in a spatio-temporal context before moving to specific notions regarding the specification of the spatial and spatio-temporal variance-covariance function. Some inference methods are also described (kriging, maximum likelihood method and Bayesian inference with a focus on INLA). Some codes are presented as an introduction to R-INLA, a R package to infer spatial and spatio-temporal models based on Bayesian inference. Here are the slides and the related codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese slides are mainly based on:\n\nWikle, C. K., Zammit-Mangion, A., & Cressie, N. Spatio-temporal Statistics with R.

John Wiley & Sons, 2015.\na workshop provided by Thomas Opitz and Denis Allard at Rochebrune.\n\n\n\n\nWorkshop on R-INLA\nThis is a short introduction to the R-INLA tool, a R package to infer spatial and spatio-temporal models through Bayesian inference. It first describes the global structure of the models implemented in R-INLA. Second, it introduces the SPDE approach and the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation, two methods implemented in R-INLA to ease the computation burden related to spatial and spatio-temporal model inference.
