    "text": "Spatial and spatio-temporal statistics for ecology\nThis is a short introduction of spatio-temporal modeling. It starts with basic concepts related to hierarchical modeling in a spatio-temporal context before moving to specific notions regarding the specification of the spatial and spatio-temporal variance-covariance function. Some inference methods are also described (kriging, maximum likelihood method and Bayesian inference with a focus on INLA). Some codes are presented to take in hand R-INLA, a R package to infer spatial and spatio-temporal models through Bayesian inference.

    "text": "Massive data sources data are progressively becoming available in the field of ecology, agronomy, epidemiology or climatology. Hunting records, healthcare data or fishermen catch declarations are common examples of such kind of data. They can reveal very informative of spatial processes such as fish or animal distribution, distribution of some disease, etc. However they also raise key methodological challenges to (1) properly integrate these data sources and (2) to infer the ecological processes of interest and extract the ecological information from these complex data sources.\nMy research focus on the development of statistical methods to infer spatio-temporal ecological processes from these massive and heterogeneous data sources. This implies developing methods that accounts for potential non-standardized sampling of the data as well as differences in the spatial resolution of the data sources. Provided these are handled, these data should be used to infer ecological mechanisms such as population dynamics at fine spatio-temporal resolution. Finally, as these data often regroup a large set of diverse variables, this requires to develop multivariate analysis suited for spatio-temporal analysis."

    "text": "Handling observation and sampling issues\nTwo major issues lies in the modelling of the sampling and of the observation process of the data.\nFor instance, sampling of these massive data sources is not necessarily standardized and in some cases it can be preferential towards the process under study (preferential sampling). In such case, not accounting for the sampling process in inference may introduce a bias in model predictions.\nThe data sources may not have the same spatial resolution. When roughly accounted for, this can lead to biased estimates too. Such issue is commonly referred as change of support.\nDeveloping methods that handle these issues is a major challenge to infer spatial processes from these massive data.\nDuring my PhD, I developed spatio-temporal hierarchical models based on fisheries data sources to map fish distribution. It feeds on massive and spatially rough catch declaration data and standardized fine-scale scientific survey data. It accounts both for preferential sampling of commercial data and for the difference of spatial support between the different data sources.\nYou’ll find some description of our approach in the following references:\n\nAlglave et al. (2022) for a spatial version of the framework.\nAlglave et al. (in press) for a spatio-temporal version of the framework.\nAlglave et al. (under review) for a model accounting for change of support.\n\n\n\n\n\nConceptual diagram of the hierarchical model"

They are extensively used for conservation and management of wildlife species. In fisheries science, these are major tools for estimating the level of exploitation of marine harvested population. These models are most often non-spatial.\nHowever, it is now recognized that including spatial dimension in those model is crucial because demographic processes have spatial variability. The development of new inference tools (INLA, TMB) has enable huge computation gains in inference of spatio-temporal models and newly available extensive data sources will provide fine scale information to inform these processes.\nIn my postdoc, based on the Management Strategy Evaluation conceptual framework, I intend to illustrate the potential and the challenges related to the spatial extension of population dynamics models."
