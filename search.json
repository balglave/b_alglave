It starts with basic concepts related to hierarchical modeling in a spatio-temporal context before moving to specific notions regarding the specification of the spatial and spatio-temporal variance-covariance function.

    "section": "Building spatial models based on declarative data",
    "text": "Building spatial models based on declarative data\nDeclarative data are progressively becoming available in many fields of research. Hunting records, healthcare data or fishermen catch declarations are common examples of such kind of data. They can reveal very informative of spatial processes such as fish or animal distribution, distribution of some disease, etc. However this requires to handle some methodological challenges to provide unbiased estimates/predictions from these data.\nTwo common processes that need to be handled are (1) preferential sampling and (2) change of support. Preferential sampling occurs when the locations of data samples are not independent from the process under study. In this case, not accounting for the sampling process in inference may introduce a bias in model predictions. Change of support is an issue that deals with reconciling spatial scales between data sets that do not have the same spatial resolution (or support). When roughly accounted for, this can lead to biased estimates too. Accounting properly for these processes is then a major challenge to infer spatial processes from declarative data and to combine these with other standardized data sets.\nDuring my PhD, I developed spatio-temporal hierarchical models based on fisheries application to map fish distribution. It feeds on both catch declaration data and scientific survey data and it accounts for preferential sampling of commercial data and for the difference of spatial support between the different data sources.\nYou’ll find some description of our approach in the following references:\n\nAlglave et al. (2022) for a spatial version of the framework.\nAlglave et al. (in press) for a spatio-temporal version of the framework.\nAlglave et al. (under review) for a model accounting for change of support.\n\n\n\n\n\nConceptual diagram of the hierarchical model"

There are strong uncertainties related to the effect of climate change on population dynamics and developing management strategies that are robust to climate change is a key challenge for fisheries science.\nACLIM aims precisely at developing and assessing management strategies that are robust to climate change. A simulation model has been developed for the Snow Crab of the Bering Sea which reproduces the population life-cycle and the assessment procedure. Based on this case study, I will explore whether the actual assessment methods are robust to climate change and if alternative spatio-temporal stock assessment models allow to handle climate change."
