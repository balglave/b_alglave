    "text": "I currently develop spatio-temporal statistical models to predict fish distribution by combining scientific survey data and catch declarations data. These later are massive data sources that are not sampled for a scientific purpose, but for a declarative purpose (like hunting records, air pollution data or healthcare data). This requires to consider potential sampling bias, data aggregation issues and many other methodological challenges related to the integration of several data sources. I also have experience with complex mechanistic population dynamics modelling and the assessment of management strategy regulations on these simulated populations (also known as Management Strategy Evaluation).\n\nPhD work\nI currently work to develop statistical models combining commercial catch declarations and scientific survey data to infer the spatio-temporal distribution of marine harvested species and identify their essential habitats. The big challenge of this work is to develop models to integrate fishermen declarations data into inference, but overall the methodological ideas that\nThis is a major challenge as these data:\n\ndo not have a standardized sampling and that may be preferentially sampled in areas of higher resources (preferential sampling).\nare often aggregated over large scales while management requires fine-scale species distribution (change of support issue).\n\nWhen properly integrated into inference, these data give access to high quantity of information at high spatial and temporal resolution (possibly the month) and allow to model processes that were inaccessible before (reproduction period, seasonal migrations, etc.). I aim at developing the methods that allow to integrate properly these data to model species distribution maps at fine spatio-temporal resolution.\nFuture (exciting!) challenges:\n\nDeveloping spatio-temporal methods to extract the main spatial and temporal patterns that structure the model predictions.\nIntegrating mechanistic processes within these models to estimate fish spatio-temporal dynamics."
