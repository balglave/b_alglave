Methods to decompose the spatio-temporal variability of the signal into simple spatial and temporal patterns have been developed for the past 50 years based on the EOFs method (Empirical Orthogonal Functions).

    "text": "Spatial and spatio-temporal statistics applied to ecology and environment\nThis is a short introduction to statistical spatio-temporal modeling. It starts with basic concepts related to hierarchical modeling in a spatio-temporal context before moving to specific notions regarding the specification of the spatial and spatio-temporal variance-covariance function. Some inference methods are also described (kriging, maximum likelihood method and Bayesian inference with a focus on INLA). Some codes are presented as an introduction to R-INLA, a R package to infer spatial and spatio-temporal models based on Bayesian inference.
