## Building spatial models based on declarative data

Declarative data are progressively becoming available in many fields of research. Hunting records, healthcare data or fishermen catch declarations are common examples of such kind of data. They can be very informative of spatial processes such as fish or animal distribution, distribution of some disease, etc. However this requires to handle some methodological challenges to provide unbiased estimates/predictions from these data. Two common processes that need to be handled are (1) preferential sampling and (2) change of support. Preferential sampling occurs when locations of data samples are not independent from the process under study. In this case, not accounting for the sampling process in inference may introduce a bias in model predictions. Change of support is an issue that deals with reconciling spatial scales between data sets that do not have the same spatial resolution (or support). When roughly accounted for, this can lead to biased estimates too. Accounting properly for these processes is then a major challenge to infer spatial processes from declarative data and to combine these with other standardized data sets.

During my PhD, I developed a spatio-temporal hierarchical model based on fisheries application to map fish distribution. It feeds on both catch declaration data and scientific survey data and it accounts for preferential sampling of commercial data as well as the difference of spatial support between the distinct data sources.

You'll find some description of our approach in the following references:
