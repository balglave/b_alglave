I am broadly interested in statistical modeling for ecology with a specific focus on spatio-temporal modeling. My main domain of application is fisheries science.

#### PhD work

I currently develop spatio-temporal statistical models to predict fish distribution by combining scientific survey data and catch declaration data. These later are massive data sources that are not sampled for a scientific purpose, but for a declarative purpose (like hunting records, air pollution data or healthcare data). This requires to deal with complex methodological issues such as sampling bias / preferential sampling or data aggregation (also referred as change of support).

#### Postodoc work

Coming soon ;)
