## Handling preferential sampling in hierarchical models

I developed an integrated spatio-temporal hierarchical model to map fish distribution. It feeds on massive catch declaration data and standardized fine-scale scientific survey data. It accounts for preferential sampling of the commercial declaration data.

You'll find some description of this approach in the following references:

- <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsac032">Alglave et al. (2022)</a> for a spatial version of the framework.

- <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03674691/">Alglave et al. (2023)</a> for a spatio-temporal version of the framework.

## Handling change of support

I also developed a statistical approach handling change of support for complex environmental data (zero-inflated data with long tails). It allows to combine (massive) areal-level data and point-level data to map fish distribution.

- <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03878990">Alglave et al. (under review)</a> for a model accounting for change of support.

## Modelling mechanisms in hierarchical spatio-temporal models

I have worked on the development of spatio-temporal population dynamics models that combines massive sources of data to tackle the effect of climate change on marine populations.

See:

- <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2023.110484">Olmos et al. (2023)</a> for a spatio-temporal model representing population dynamics of the Snow Crab in the Eastern Bering Sea.

- <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsae002">Rovellini et al. (2024)</a> for a mechanistic spatio-temporal model linking climate stressors to ecological processes.

## Dimension reduction for spatial/spatio-temporal data

Massive data sources give access to huge amount of spatial information over long time series. Methods to reduce the dimension of these data are critical to analyse and interpret such data.

Here are some references to my work:

- <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04693871">Alglave et al. (under review)</a> for an introduction to the basics of EOFs and some statistical development of EOFs.

- <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsac032">Alglave et al. (2024)</a> for an application of EOFs to identify essential habitats from a spatio-temporal species distrution model.
