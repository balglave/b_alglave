I currently give the following courses at University Bretagne Sud and Institut Agro (Rennes). The teaching material should be online soon.

-   **Descriptive statistics** (Bachelor)

-   **Maximum likelihood estimation** (Bachelor)

-   **Introduction to spatial and spatio-temporal statistics** (Bachelor and Master)

-   **Bayesian linear model** (Master)

<!--# Sampling and experimental design (Bachelor) -->

In addition, here are two workshops that I frequently give to ecologists and/or statisticians as an introduction to spatio-temporal modeling for ecology.

### Spatial and spatio-temporal statistics applied to ecology and environment

This is a short introduction to statistical spatio-temporal modeling. It starts with basic concepts related to hierarchical modeling in a spatio-temporal context before moving to specific notions regarding the specification of the spatial and spatio-temporal variance-covariance function. Some inference methods are also described (kriging, maximum likelihood method and Bayesian inference with a focus on INLA). Some codes are presented as an introduction to `R-INLA`, a R package to infer spatial and spatio-temporal models based on Bayesian inference. Here are the <a href=ressource/pdf/cours_td_stats_st_2022.pdf>slides</a> and the related <a href=https://github.com/balglave/workshop/tree/main/cours_td_stats_st_2022/>codes</a>.

### Workshop on R-INLA

This is a short introduction to the `R-INLA` tool, a R package to infer spatial and spatio-temporal models through Bayesian inference. It first describes the global structure of the models implemented in `R-INLA`. Second, it introduces the SPDE approach and the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation, two methods implemented in `R-INLA` to ease the computation burden related to spatial and spatio-temporal model inference. Here are the <a href=ressource/pdf/td_halieut_inla_2022.pdf>slides</a> and the related <a href=https://github.com/balglave/workshop/tree/main/td_halieut_inla/>codes</a>.
