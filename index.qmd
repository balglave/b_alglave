I am a PhD student working for Ifremer and Institut Agro (Rennes). I'm finishing my last year of phD (hopefully, will survive this last year... ;) ). I am mainly specialized in fisheries science, quantitative ecology and statistical modelling. I actually develop methods for understanding how exploited fish population are distributed in space and time. You'll find plenty of details in the following pages!

If you want to contact me, here are some information!
