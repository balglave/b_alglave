I am a quantitative ecologist and applied statistician with a specific interest in spatio-temporal modeling and applications in fisheries science and marine ecology. During my PhD, I developed statistical hierarchical models combining commercial catch declarations data and scientific survey data to infer fish spatio-temporal distribution and identify their essential habitats. Specifically, I developed methods to account for preferential sampling of commercial data and difference of spatial resolution between distinct data sources (change of support issues).

Since January 2023, Iâ€™m a post-doc fellow at the University of Washington (Seattle, USA) to develop spatio-temporal population dynamics models to project and address the effect of climate change on harvested population with a specific focus on the Snow Crab of the Bering Sea.

I also have interest in methods related to community ecology and inference of dynamic systems (differential equations).
