I am an applied statistician with a specific interest in statistical modeling applied to ecology and environment. I currently work at University Bretagne Sud as associate professor in statistics (IUT Vannes, Data Science department). Regarding research, I work within the GIS group of the Lab-STICC (UMR 6285, <a href="https://labsticc.fr/fr/equipes/decide"> DECIDE team</a>).

My research focus on the **statistical integration of heterogeneous datasets to infer spatio-temporal ecological and environmental processes**. My main fields of application are biogeography (*i.e* species distribution), marine ecology, geography and micro-climate of urban areas.

You'll find additional details in the following pages!
