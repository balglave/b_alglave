I am an applied statistician with a specific interest in spatio-temporal modeling and applications in environment. During my PhD, I developed statistical hierarchical models combining commercial catch declarations data and scientific survey data to infer fish spatio-temporal distribution and identify their essential habitats for use in Marine Spatial Planning. Specifically, I developed methods to combine heterogeneous and massive data sources while accounting for preferential sampling of fisheries commercial data and difference in spatial resolution between the distinct data sources (change of support issues).

From January to June 2023, I was a post-doc fellow at the University of Washington (Seattle, USA) to develop spatio-temporal population dynamics models to project and address the effect of climate change on harvested population with the Snow Crab of the Bering Sea as case study.

I am now assistant professor at the University Institute of Technology (IUT) in Vannes and at the Lab-STICC for research (DECIDE team). With the group focused on GIS, I am working on the interaction of urban landscape and climate. We aim at developing operational tools to help managers to plan urban areas in a context of land pressure, threat on ecosystems and climate change.
