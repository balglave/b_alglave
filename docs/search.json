    "text": "Identifying cities profiles with regards to urban overheating factors\nModeling species distribution in space and time is a key challenge for conservation. Typically, such information is crucial to identify essential habitats or biodiversity hotspots and to design protected areas.\nThanks to citizen science and declarative data, a massive amount of data is becoming available to address these challenges at an unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution.\nMy research seeks to develop spatio-temporal statistical methods to integrate these datasets for mapping species distribution in space and time.\nIntegrating all these datasets raises strong methodological issues. Typically, combining multiple and heterogeneous datasets in a single statistical framework requires to account for potential sampling bias (opportunistic/preferential sampling). Data are also often available at a rough scale, while the process under study need to be available at a fine scale (change of support or change of scale problem).\nWhen all the data are integrated, they give access to a huge amount of information on species distribution (i.e. information available over large spatial domains and long time period). Providing a low rank representation of the process of interest is pivotal to identify the main mechanisms shaping species spatio-temporal distribution (dimension-reduction).\nIn the few sections below, I present the different axes of my research work. I first present the methodological bottlenecks that need to be addressed before integrating the datasets (preferential sampling, change of support). I then introduce a model to integrate data while accounting for preferential sampling and change of support. I finally deal with dimension-reduction methods for spatio-temporal data.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbundance spatio-temporal predictions of an integrated population dynamics model (Olmos et al., 2023)"
