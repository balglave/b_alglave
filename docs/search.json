The big challenge of this work is to develop models to integrate fishermen declarations data into inference, but overall the methodological ideas that\nThis is a major challenge as these data:\n\ndo not have a standardized sampling and that may be preferentially sampled in areas of higher resources (preferential sampling).\nare often aggregated over large scales while management requires fine-scale species distribution (change of support issue).\n\nWhen properly integrated into inference, these data give access to high quantity of information at high spatial and temporal resolution (possibly the month) and allow to model processes that were inaccessible before (reproduction period, seasonal migrations, etc.). I aim at developing the methods that allow to integrate properly these data to model species distribution maps with fine spatio-temporal resolution."
