title: "Statistics & methods"

**Modelling approach:** hierarchical modeling, species distribution models, spatio-temporal statistics, data integration, multivariate analysis.

**Inference methods:** I mainly build my models under Template Model Builder (<a href=https://kaskr.github.io/adcomp/Introduction.html>TMB</a>), a package mainly built for Maximum Likelihood Estimation. I also have some experience with Bayesian inference (<a href=https://www.r-inla.org/>R-INLA</a>, JAGS and <a href=https://r-nimble.org/Nimble>R-INLA</a>).

**Languages:** mainly R and C++ but also some Java, SQL and Python.

For some personal TMB codes examples, see the <a href=https://github.com/balglave/example_tmb_ba>link</a>

## FishMap hierarchical model

A hierarchical model to integrate scientific survey data and commercial catch declarations data to infer species distribution at fine spatio-temporal resolution.

## Multivariate analysis of spatio-temporal data

In progress
