**Modelling approach:** hierarchical modeling, species distribution models, spatio-temporal statistics, data integration, multivariate analysis.

**Inference methods:** I mainly build my models under Template Model Builder, a package mainly built for Maximum Likelihood Estimation. I also have some experience with Bayesian inference (R-INLA, JAGS and Nimble).

**Languages:** mainly R and C++ but also some Java, SQL and Python.
